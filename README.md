# Palindromic-resistance

The function PalindromskaOtpornost receives a vector of numbers and returns a vector of palindromic resistance numbers. We get the vector of palindromic resistances by adding each number to the number obtained by turning its digits, until we get the same number on both sides. The number of additions represents the palindromic resistance.
